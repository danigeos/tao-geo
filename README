tAo is a C program for Linux to calculate the flexure of the lithosphere and, 
more in general, to numerically simulate the formation of foreland basins in 
pseudo 2D (vertical cross section). 
The pseudo 3D version of tAo is called TISC and distributed apart.
Read the 'tao/doc/tao.info.txt' file to know more about tAo.

Disclaimer: tAo is a tool developed for my own research. I've never been a
professional programmer, the code is not user-friendly as a mobile app, and i
cannot guarantee assistance in case of  trouble. See other disclaimers in the

tAo has been developed in C under UNIX operating system (iOS, AIX IBM). It has 
been also successfully compiled in linux UNIX PC and in a Hewlett Packard 
Workstation using HP UX.


TO INSTALL tAo:

-Uncompress and untar the file containing tAo using the unix command 
	'gunzip -c tao.tar.gz | tar -xvf -'
this will create directory 'tao/' in your current directory.

-Check the compiling options in 'tao/config.mk'.

-Compile typing  'make' in the main directory. This will create the executable 
tao in the bin/ directory. You should put tao/bin/ and tao/script/ in your path
and define the tao_dir variable in your environment.

-Optionally install GMT free-ware software (used for graphic output) and put 
its bin/ directory in your path. This should work:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install gmt ksh csh tofrodos

-Try examples of how to run tAo in the directory 'tao/demo/'. This will allow
you to be sure that the code is working properly. Check that the graphic
output is correctly produced in the postscript output files (*.ps).
